Prerna,

Some time ago, I asked you whether you care about Valentine’s week.
This is why.I thought why can't you have little suprises,,, I wanted to create something,in my own way.

You might wonder why I’m doing this.
Maybe there isn’t a perfect reason, but you're special.
I just felt like saying it,because you matter to me.

The future will decide where we stand.
But since the day we started talking,
I’ve noticed something change in me.

I began seeing things differently.
I picked up new habits.
I started appreciating the way you think.

Maybe you are a little crazy.
But when you connect with someone,
everything about them feels beautiful.

So today, I make a simple promise —

I will try not to hurt you.
I will make sure you feel heard.
I will respect your individuality.
I will try to understand you — patiently, honestly.
And I will offer you a little bit of my craziness too.


Happy Promise Day.
